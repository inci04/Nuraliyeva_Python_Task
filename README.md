## Description Task 1

This project is a Python GUI application built with `tkinter`.  
It performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if an entered number is greater than 7 → prints "Hello"
2. Checks if the entered name is "John" → prints "Hello, John", otherwise "There is no such name"
3. Takes an input array and prints elements that are multiples of 3




## Task 2

**Question:**  
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]  
Can this sequence be considered correct?

**Answer:**  
No, the sequence is not correct. The brackets are unbalanced.

 The correct version is: `[ ((())()(()) ) ]`
 Only one closing square bracket should be at the end  and one of the square brackets with a round bracket
